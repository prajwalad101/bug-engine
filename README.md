## About The Project

![bugengine-landing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84787320/167077488-11e60480-b9f0-4a99-8274-b803052e045a.PNG)


BugEngine is an simple and minimalistic issue tracker that helps you to track bugs in your project. The interface is simple to use so that the learning curve application is extremly minimal. The project focuses only on the core functionalities that you will need to track issues. 

If you are working on a large development team, then this application might not be the right choice for you as it is mainly made for personal projects with a team of 3-8 people.

Here are some of the main features of the application:
* Helps you to save time by removing unnecessary issue tracking features for individuals.
* Simple and easy to use for beginners.
* It is flexible and can be used any way you want. And did I also mention it's free :smile:
